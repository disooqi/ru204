00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,370
Welcome to the first section
of RU204, Managing JSON

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,630
Data in Redis.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,480
In the next four units,
you'll learn the following,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,580
the rationale for
using the Redis JSON

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,280
module over the core
Redis offering, how

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,090
to store JSON documents
in Redis with Redis JSON,

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,880
how to retrieve subdocuments
and specific values

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,510
within documents, how to
update existing documents

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,090
and add new
subdocuments and values.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,940
Each unit will have a
hands-on exercise designed

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,940
to explore the topics covered
and solidify your Redis JSON

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,260
skills.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,110
Since the goal of this
section is to familiarize you

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,390
with Redis JSON,
the exercises will

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,390
be based on entering commands
into the Command Line Interface

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,790
to demonstrate common actions
performed on JSON documents.
