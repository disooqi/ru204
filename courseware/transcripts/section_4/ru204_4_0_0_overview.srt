[BIRDS CHIRPING]

[BELL RINGING]

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,220


4
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,630
You've reached Section
4 of the course.

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,950
Now it's time to see how you
can integrate the JSON search

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,470
capabilities that were
introduced in Section 3

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,120
into your application.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,290
We'll look at examples written
in Python, .NET, Node.js,

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,700
and Java.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,430
You'll learn how to query
a collection of documents

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,140
with the Redisson clients.

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,720
Remember that to be
successful in this course,

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,750
you don't need to know all
four programming languages.

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,780
While we'd recommend that you
read each unit that follows,

15
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,910
feel free to focus
on the languages that

16
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,890
are relevant to your
application development

17
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,960
needs and personal experience.

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,090
It's also important
to note that you

19
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,640
don't have to use the
Redisson clients to leverage

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,060
functionality from
RediSearch in an application.

21
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,540
The lower-level clients
redis-py, Node Redis,

22
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,960
and Jedis all include support
for RediSearch commands.

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,300
And StackExchange.Redis
allows you

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,170
to run these commands using the
generic ExecuteAsync function

25
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,400
to send arbitrary
commands to Redis.
