00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,350
Hello.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,570
And welcome to Redis University.

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,970
We're so happy you've signed up for this class.

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,370
We hope you gain as many insights and techniques

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,650
as you need to get the most out of Redis.

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,170
But before we dive into the course content, let's

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,270
deal with some logistics first.

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,700
Each course is broken down into a series of chapters.

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,660
Each chapter is made up of between 30 and 45 minutes

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,550
of videos to review.

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,680
The videos are 5 to 7 minutes in length,

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,660
with quizzes at the end of each to help

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,610
you check your understanding.

16
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,080
At the end of each chapter, there

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,960
may be labs and homework questions for you to complete.

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,073
The labs aren't graded, but the homework questions are.

19
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,490
Depending on the course and you're

20
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,110
familiarity with the material, you

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,570
should expect to spend anywhere from 1 to 2 hours

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,630
on each week's videos, labs, and homework questions.

23
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,540
Now keep in mind that you're not alone in taking this course.

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,880
Along with the other students enrolled in the course,

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,710
our teachers and other engineers are

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,150
available to help if you get stuck

27
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,980
or need more clarification.

28
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,660
Just click on the discussion tab,

29
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,730
head over to our Discord server, will be

30
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,410
there to answer your questions.

31
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,750
Most of our courses have a public GitHub repo

32
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,760
containing all of the example code

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,070
on how to set up a lab environment at home.

34
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,200
It's here that we'll also provide instructions

35
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,390
for setting up your own Redis server,

36
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,610
whether that's by launching a Docker instance

37
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,220
or compiling their Redis code base and running it locally.

38
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,660
Now all the homework questions count towards your final grade.

39
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,470
And during the last week of the course,

40
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,590
you'll be given a final exam.

41
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,890
50% of your final grade will come from each chapter's

42
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,940
homework questions.

43
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,370
And the remaining 50% will come from the score

44
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,270
on your final exam.

45
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,450
You'll need to score a 65% or better

46
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,210
to get a certification of completion.

47
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,360
Of course, let's not let grades get in the way of learning.

48
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,630
Most of all, we want to ensure that you have a fun

49
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,710
and engaging learning experience.

50
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,430
So jump into the discussion, say Hi,

51
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,260
and provide us with any feedback you might have.

52
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,240
Thanks again for joining this course.

53
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,140
We're excited to have you here, and we wish you all the best

54
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,610
in your Redis learning journey.
