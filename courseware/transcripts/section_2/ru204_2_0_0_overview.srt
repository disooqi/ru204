00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[BELL RINGING]

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,390
Now that you've seen how to
create and manage JSON document

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,510
data in Redis using Redis
CLI and RedisInsight,

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,640
it's time to switch
gears and consider

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,310
how to use the
capabilities of RedisJSON

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,870
in your application code.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,230
In this section, you'll learn
what Redis client libraries are

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,320
and how to use them to
execute RedisJSON commands

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,150
from popular
programming languages.

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,460
We'll then show you how
to model and persist

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,190
document data using the
higher-level [? RedisOM ?]

14
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,480
family of clients.

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,540
Let's get started.
