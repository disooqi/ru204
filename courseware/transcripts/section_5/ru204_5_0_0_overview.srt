00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,330
Welcome to Section 5 where we'll
discuss advanced topics that

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,180
will assist you in integrating
RedisSearch and RedisJSON

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,920
into your application.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,560
The commands and topics
covered in this section

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,150
may not be necessary
for every application.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,980
However, it is important to
know that such actions do exist

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,380
should certain scenarios arise.

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,960
RedisSearch and
RedisJSON are constantly

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,670
evolving with new
features and capabilities.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,680
So this section will expand as
newer versions are released.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,110
As always, we
encourage you to jump

15
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,840
into the discussion on
Discord as we are always

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,620
interested in what our students
would like to see covered.

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,630
This will be a light
section with one

18
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,030
collective hands-on
activity at the end.

19
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,100
Well then proceed
to the final exam

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,870
where you can earn a
certificate of completion

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,040
if you reach a grade
of 65% or higher.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,820
Good luck and happy learning.
