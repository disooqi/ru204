<p>You've seen how to work with JSON documents in Redis using some of the most popular Redis clients available.  These general purpose clients generally map each Redis command to a function call in the programming language that they support.  While this makes for a quick and easy API to learn, it also means that you're operating at a low level of abstraction and need to know a lot about individual Redis commands.</p>
<p>When storing document data in a database, it's common to use object mapping tools to handle the conversion of objects in your programming language to a particular database and storage model.  For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping" class="page-link" target="_blank">Object Relational Mapping</a> tools (commonly referred to as ORMs) are used to provide a higher level interface between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases.</p>
<p>The Redis OM family of clients were designed to provide this level of abstraction when working with document data in Redis.  Rather than working with arbitrary JSON document structures and low-level commands such as <span class="code">JSON.SET</span>, the Redis OM clients allow you to define an object model and persist domain objects to Redis simply by calling a "save" function.  This makes for more readable code, and saves developers from having to learn the specifics of many Redis commands - the client abstracts this away for you.</p>
<p>There are four Redis OM clients, one each for Python, Node.js, .NET (C#) and Java (Spring).  Each has been designed with the conventions and idioms of the target language in mind, so should feel familiar to developers.</p>
<p>In the modules that follow, we'll introduce you to the object mapping capabilities of the Redis OM clients with RedisJSON.  Later, in section 4, you'll learn how these clients also provide an easy to learn yet powerful query interface to retrieve and aggregate document data using the power of RediSearch.</p>
<p>To get a feel for how each client works, check out the video that follows before diving into example code where you'll see how to model our book objects in the four supported languages.</p>
