<p>We've shown you the basics of JSON data modeling with the four Redis OM clients, now it's your turn to try it out in your preferred programming language.</p>
<p>If you're not a coder, don't worry - this is an ungraded exercise!</p>
<h2>Coding Exercise</h2>
<hr>
<p>Imagine we're operating a video rental store.  We've decided to represent each of the movies in our inventory using JSON documents that have the following structure:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
{
"title": "The Matrix",
"released": 1999,
"runtime": 137,
"stars": [
    "Keanu Reeves",
    "Laurence Fishburne",
    "Carrie-Ann Moss"
],
"Summary": "A stranger leads computer hacker Neo to a forbidding underworld, he discovers the truth: the life he knows is the elaborate deception of an evil cyber-intelligence."
} 
</pre></p>
<p>Using the sample code from the previous modules as a template, write code in your preferred language that uses the Redis OM client to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model the JSON structure above as an entity of class <span class="code">Movie</span>.</li>
<li>Create some <span class="code">Movie</span> instances for 2-3 of your favorite movies (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank" class="page-link">look them up on IMDB</a>!)</li>
<li>Persist them to Redis, and verify that the correct JSON structure is stored in Redis for each document.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't forget that you'll need to have your Redis Stack instance up and running with the course sample data loaded.  If you need help with this, please consult the <a href="https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru204/" target="_blank" class="page-link">README</a> in the course GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Check that your code worked by using RedisInsight or the redis-cli to view the contents of the database.</p>
<p>Should you need help or would like to share your success with Redis staff and your fellow students, reach out to us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/46upnugY5B" target="_blank" class="page-link">course Discord channel</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
