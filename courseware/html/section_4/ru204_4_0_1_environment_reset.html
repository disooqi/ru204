<p>Before going further, let's clean up your environment a bit and reset it to a known state:</p>
<p>1. If you&apos;re running Redis Stack in Docker, make sure that the container is running.  If you&apos;re using Redis Stack in the cloud, there&apos;s nothing to do for this step so go to step 2!</p>
<p>2. Connect to your Redis instance using redis-cli or RedisInsight.  If you're using RedisInsight, open up the built-in CLI.</p>
<p>3. Enter the following command to delete all of the keys and search indexes in Redis:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
FLUSHDB
</pre></p>
<p>Redis should respond with:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
OK
</pre></p>
<p>4. Make sure that you have the latest version of the course repository files on your machine.  Run the following command in your local <span class="code">ru204</span> folder:</p>
<p><pre class="code">
git pull origin main
</pre></p>
