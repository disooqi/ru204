<p>You&apos;ve reached section 4 of the course!  Now it&apos;s time to see how you can integrate the JSON search capabilities that were introduced in section 3 into your application.  We&apos;ll look at examples written in Python, .NET (C#), Node.js and Java.  You&apos;ll learn how to query a collection of documents with the Redis OM clients.</p>
<p>Remember that to be successful on this course, you don&apos;t need to know all four of the programming languages.  While we&apos;d recommend that you read each unit that follows, feel free to focus on the language(s) that are relevant to your application development needs and personal experience.</p>
<p>It&apos;s also important to note that you don&apos;t have to use the Redis OM clients to leverage functionality from RediSearch in an application.  The lower level clients <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-py" target="_blank" class="page-link">redis-py</a> (Python), <a href="https://github.com/redis/node-redis" target="_blank" class="page-link">Node-Redis</a> (Node.js), <a href="https://github.com/redis/jedis" target="_blank" class="page-link">Jedis</a> (Java) all include support for RediSearch commands, and <a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/" target="_blank" class="page-link">StackExchange.Redis</a> (.NET) allows you to run these commands using the generic <span class="code">ExecuteAsync</span> function to send arbitrary commands to Redis.</p>
