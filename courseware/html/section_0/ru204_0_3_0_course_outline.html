<p>Let's take a look at what we'll be covering in this course...</p>
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<hr>
<p>We'll begin by getting your environment set up and ready for the course.  You'll see how to get your own instance of Redis Stack either in the cloud or using Docker, and how to interact with it using redis-cli and the RedisInsight graphical management tool.</p>
<p>After loading the sample data set and running a test query, you'll be ready to move on.</p>
<h2>Section 1: Managing JSON Data in Redis</h2>
<hr>
<p>Here we'll take a brief look at ways of storing JSON data in Redis Strings and Hashes, and what the shortcomings of those strategies are.</p>
<p>Next you'll learn about what RedisJSON is: we'll introduce several of the commands that it provides for working with JSON as a native Redis data type.  You'll see how to store, retrieve, and atomically update JSON documents in Redis from the command line.</p>
<h2>Section 2: Application Development with RedisJSON</h2>
<hr>
<p>In this section, we'll examine how to write code that uses the features of RedisJSON.  We'll first touch on coding with the following popular Redis clients:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-py" target="_blank" class="page-link">redis-py</a> for Python.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/redis/node-redis" target="_blank" class="page-link">node-redis</a> for Node.js.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/redis/jedis" target="_blank" class="page-link">jedis</a> for Java.</li>
  <li><a href="https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/" target="_blank" class="page-link">StackExchange.Redis</a> for .NET languages (we'll provide C# examples).</li>
</ul>
<p>When working with document data, developers may prefer to work at a higher level of abstraction when modeling their entities.  In this section you'll be introduced to the <a href="https://redis.com/blog/introducing-redis-om-client-libraries/" target="_blank" class="page-link">Redis OM family of clients</a> and see how they provide object mapping between JSON documents stored in Redis and the Python, Node.js, Java and C# programming languages.</p>
<p>Note that to be successful in this course, you don't need to be proficient at coding in Python, Node.js, Java or C# but you should check out the code samples for language(s) that you write applications in.  There won't be any programming language specific questions on the final exam, we promise!</p>
<h2>Section 3: Indexing and Searching JSON Documents</h2>
<hr>
<p>RedisJSON works hand-in-hand with RediSearch to provide powerful secondary indexing and full-text search capabilities for JSON documents stored in Redis.  Here, you can expect to learn how to define a search index and run queries against it from the redis-cli and RedisInsight.  We'll also touch on the topic of how to group, sort and transform query results with aggregations.</p>
<p>If you'd like to take a really deep dive into the RediSearch query language, we recommend that you also check out the <a href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru203/" class="page-link" target="_blank">RU203: Querying, Indexing and Full-Text Search</a> course.</p>
<h2>Section 4: Indexing and Searching in Your Application</h2>
<hr>
<p>In section 4, we'll show you how to build applications that take advantage of the modeling and fluent querying capabilities of the <a href="https://redis.com/blog/introducing-redis-om-client-libraries/" target="_blank" class="page-link">Redis OM clients</a> to manage collections of JSON documents in Redis.</p>
<p>We'll explore code written in Python, Node.js, Java and C#.  Again, remember you don't have to be proficient in all of these languages to be successful with this course.</p>
<h2>Section 5: Advanced Topics</h2>
<p>In this section, we'll introduce you to some additional capabilities of RedisJSON and the Redis OM clients.</p>
<h2>Final Exam</h2>
<hr>
<p>The last section of the course is your final exam.  This is optional, but we'd encourage you to take it as you can earn yourself a certificate of completion that can be added to your LinkedIn profile as a professional credential.</p>
<p>The final exam is a series of multiple choice questions that test your knowledge of the course materials.  There's no time limit when it comes to taking the exam, and you're welcome to use the course content and other external resources to help you.</p>
<p>If you get stuck or need a hint, just reach out to the Redis University team <a href="https://discord.gg/46upnugY5B" target="_blank" class="page-link">on Discord</a>, we're here to help.  Good luck and enjoy the course!</p>
