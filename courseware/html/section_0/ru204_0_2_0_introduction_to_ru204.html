<p>Hello and welcome to Redis University. This is RU204: Storing, Querying, and Indexing JSON at Speed.</p>

<p>We're <a href="https://simonprickett.dev/" target="_blank" class="page-link">Simon Prickett</a> and <a href="http://www.justincastilla.com" target="_blank" class="page-link">Justin Castilla</a>, Developer Advocates at Redis,  and we'll be helping you along the way as you progress through this course.</p>
<p>Before we start, we want to give you an overview of the course and show you how to get the most from the time you’re investing here. This course is for any developer interested in storing and querying JSON documents within Redis. We expect that students at this point have a comfortable understanding of JSON documents and of using Redis as a data store. If you'd like to check out a standalone course on Redis data structures, consider taking <a href="https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/" target="_blank" class="page-link">RU101: Introduction to Redis Data Structures</a>. All of the core Redis data structures and best practices are covered in detail.</p>
<p>This course includes many hands-on exercises to give you practice storing, creating, and updating JSON documents in Redis as well as creating indexes and writing queries with RediSearch. Each exercise gives you an opportunity to practice a concept or type of query we've just covered.</p>
<p>You'll also have the chance to explore language-specific Redis client libraries to make application development straightforward, easy, and fast.  We've included examples for Python, Node.js, Java and .NET.</p>
<p>The hands-on activities aren’t graded, but we recommend that you spend time doing each of them.  There’s no substitute for learning by doing, and we believe that you’ll learn best by working directly with the <a href="https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/" target="_blank" class="page-link">RedisInsight</a> User Interface or the Redis CLI.</p>
<p>At the end of the course you will have the opportunity to complete a final exam. A score of 65% or better will grant you a certificate of completion to add to your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>If you ever need any assistance with the exercises or need clarification with the content, don't hesitate to ask in the <a href="https://discord.gg/46upnugY5B" target="_blank" class="page-link">RU204 Discord channel</a>. Our Redis Discord server has dedicated channels for each course and various sections where you can get answers to your questions from community members, course instructors, and Redis employees.  We're always more than happy to help.</p> 
<p>Good luck in the course, and we'll see you in the next section!</p>
