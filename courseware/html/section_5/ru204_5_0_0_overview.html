<p>Welcome to Section 5, where we&apos;ll discuss advanced topics that will assist you in integrating RediSearch and RedisJSON into your application. The commands and topics covered in this section may not be necessary for every application, however it is important to know that such actions exist should certain scenarios arise. RediSearch and RedisJSON are constantly evolving with new features and capabilities, so this section will expand as newer versions are released.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage you to <a href="https://discord.gg/46upnugY5B" target="_blank" class="page-link">jump into the discussion in Discord</a>, as we are always interested in what our students would like to see covered.</p>
<p>This will be a light section with one collective hands-on activity at the end. We&apos;ll then proceed to the Final Exam, where you can earn a Certificate of Completion if you reach a grade of 65% or higher.</p>
<p>Good luck and happy learning!</p>
