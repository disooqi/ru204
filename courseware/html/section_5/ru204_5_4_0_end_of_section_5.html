<p>Well done, you&apos;ve completed section 5 and reached the end of the course!  We hope that this course has inspired you to use RedisJSON and RediSearch in your own projects.  What do you plan to build?  We&apos;d love to hear from you in <a href="https://discord.gg/46upnugY5B" target="_blank" class="page-link">Discord</a>!</p>
<p>What&apos;s next?  To receive a certificate of completion for this course, you&apos;ll need to take the final exam.  The exam is a set of multiple choice questions with no time limits, and you are free to refer to all of the course materials when taking it.  You&apos;ll need to score 65% or higher to pass.</p>
<p>Best of luck, and thank you for taking the course!</p>
