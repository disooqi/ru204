<p>Welcome to the first section of RU204: Managing JSON Data in Redis. 
    In the next four units you will learn the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rationale for using the RedisJSON module over the core Redis offering.</li>
  <li>How to store JSON documents in Redis with RedisJSON.</li>
  <li>How to retrieve subdocuments and specific values within documents.</li>
  <li>How to update existing documents and add new subdocuments and values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each unit will have a hands-on exercise designed to explore the topics covered and solidify your RedisJSON skills. Since the goal of this section is to familiarize you with RedisJSON, the exercises will be based on entering commands into the command-line interface to demonstrate common actions performed on JSON documents.</p>
