But the scientists were unaware that the alien ecosystem was more developed than the primitive life forms originally discovered.Now, thousands of years later, the Portiids and their humans have sent an exploration vessel following fragmentary radio signals. They discover a system in crisis, warring factions trying to recover from an apocalyptic catastrophe arising from what the early terraformers awoke all those years before.",
