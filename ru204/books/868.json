In the frozen Alaskan wilderness, former state trooper Jenna Darrow survives an unspeakable breach of body and soul. But with her narrow escape comes an even greater challenge. For strange changes are taking place within her, as she struggles to understand\u2014and control\u2014a new hunger. To do so, she will seek shelter in the Boston compound of the Order, an ancient race of vampire warriors whose very existence is shrouded in mystery.

As she recovers under Brock\u2019s care, Jenna finds herself drawn to the Order\u2019s mission: to stop a ruthless enemy and its army of assassins from subjecting Earth to a reign of terror. Yet in spite of their resolve, a purely physical relationship without strings soon binds Brock and Jenna together with a desire fiercer than life and stronger than death itself\u2014until a secret from Brock\u2019s past and Jenna\u2019s own mortality challenges their forbidden love to the ultimate trial by fire.",
