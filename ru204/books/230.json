Especially not tall, dark and sinfully handsome Tristan-a man hard to resist, and determined to fulfill her every desire.Though Tristan was a rogue of the battlefield and the boudoir, making love with Julia was like nothing he'd ever known. Yet revealing his true heart would break the centuries-old spell and separate them forever. And Tristan would do anything to go on loving Julia. . .even remain a slave through all eternity. . .",
