He doesn\u2019t even mind that most nights are lonely on remote Cassa, but he does need help around his farm. A mail-order bride from his homeworld seems like the perfect solution. She\u2019ll be a tall, sturdy female to help with the chores and bear his children.Unfortunately, the person that arrives is Nicola. She\u2019s small, delicate\u2026 and human.

She's a problem, and also the most enticing thing he's ever seen.Now Emvor has to decide\u2026 can he keep the woman who\u2019s nothing like what he asked for but is everything he needs?",
