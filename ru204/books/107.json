    "book_description": "Althea and Lucas barely escaped the Others\u2019 clutches in the autumn, and were separated in the process. Alone and on the run from the cruel alien race determined to exterminate her, Althea struggles to adapt and survive in a world she never imagined. When a boy named Pax appears out of nowhere, he quickly recognizes Althea for what she is \u2013 a human/Other hybrid just like him. Althea begs him to help her find Lucas, but Pax refuses, intent on following his own mysterious agenda. The Others\u2019 presence continues to devour the planet\u2019s resources, and if history is an indication, they won\u2019t leave until Earth is destroyed beyond repair. Althea and Pax sense the only way to save themselves \u2013 and maybe their home \u2013 is to understand the powers simmering inside them. Together they push the limits of their capabilities in the quiet Wilds, but are soon confronted with a terrifying fact: no place is safe from the relentless pursuit of the Others.Least of all their own minds.",
