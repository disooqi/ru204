    "book_description": "Commander Alexandria Frazier headed up NASA's first deep-space mission to search for other habitable planets in distant galaxies. Where only two years have passed by for the crew of the Methuselah, fifteen hundred years have ticked by on Earth. Alex and her crew were prepared for that eventuality.

Welcome to earth in the year 100,000,007 A.D. Prepare to scream.",
