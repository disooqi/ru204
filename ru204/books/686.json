And they didn\u2019t bid on me out of the goodness of their hearts.FML.Then this nice alien showed up in the nick of time, but he keeps referring to me as \u201cPrincess\u201d and I\u2019m starting to worry what he\u2019ll do when he finds out that there\u2019s been a little case of mistaken identity, that I\u2019m not royalty - see, I\u2019m not even whatever alien he mistook me for\u2026I\u2019m just a human.***Note to readers: This was previously titled ABDUCTED, AUCTIONED, & STOLEN BY AN ALIEN.",
