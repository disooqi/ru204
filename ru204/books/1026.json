    "book_description": "Twelve humans are left stranded on a wintry alien planet. I\u2019m one of them. Yay, me. In order to survive, we have to take on a symbiont that wants to rewire our bodies to live in this brutal place. I like to call it a cootie. And my cootie\u2019s a jerk, because it also thinks I\u2019m the mate to the biggest, surliest alien of the group. BARBARIAN ALIEN is a sequel to ICE PLANET BARBARIANS. You do not have to read both in order to understand the plot, but the story will be richer if you do!",
