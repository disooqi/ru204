She\u2019s doing a man\u2019s job, with only her father\u2019s brutal reputation and three androids to help keep her alive when she sees a massive, handsome cyborg chained to a freight table. The abusive crew plans to sell him to fight in gruesome death matches. It\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s insane, but Jill can\u2019t leave him to such a horrible fate. Coal has survived being a captive breeding slave and irreversible damage to his cyborg implants, but his honor is still intact. He\u2019s grateful Jill saved him and he\u2019ll repay her the only way he can. He\u2019ll fix her\u2014with his mouth, his hands and his body. He can teach the little human just how much pleasure she\u2019s capable of feeling.",
