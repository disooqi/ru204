He has no memory, no future of his own, yet deep inside Pasha knows that that he is meant for better things.

Returning Helios to his position on the throne is the only right thing to do, yet Griffin knows that in doing so, he risks losing his lover forever.\"A whore is a whore is a whore, unless he's something else completely. I guess I must be an uncommon whore.\"-- Helios Dayspring",
