His determination leads him to the extreme. The only place left to look is a planet within a sun. A planet full of ice and snow and emptiness, except for one little female, Zabbie.Zabbie is hard and tough, a little warrior who has thwarted death too many times to count. Resigned to dying of exposure to either ice or fire, she can\u2019t make heads or tails of the strange alien who lands within her hell. One thing she knows for certain, whether or not Titus is real, she\u2019s keeping the emotional male in turmoil, and will go to any length to catch a warrior.",
