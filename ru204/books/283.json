    "book_description": " Who knew reading sexy alien abduction stories could get a girl into trouble?Or that an e-reader could also be the gateway to another galaxy? I definitely didn't... but here I am anyway, mated to the Tsenturion High Commander just like the unwilling human heroines in my favorite sci-fi romances.\nThe Commander demands obedience. He intends to claim me, train me, and turn me into his perfect little pleasure trophy.\nHe doesn't believe in love. I don't believe in giving in without a fight.There's no amount of discipline or ecstasy that could break me to his will... I hope.\nAlien Captive is a hot alien abduction romance, starring one feisty human and the Tsenturion Warrior strong enough to master her.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: the authors are not responsible for any actual alien abductions that may result should you purchase this book.\n\n",
