But even free energy has a price. The transference process itself will eventually lead to the destruction of the Earth's Sun--and of Earth itself.Only a few know the terrifying truth--an outcast Earth scientist, a rebellious alien inhabitant of a dying planet, a lunar-born human intuitionist who senses the imminent annihilation of the Sun.They know the truth--but who will listen?They have foreseen the cost of abundant energy--but who will believe?These few beings, human and alien, hold the key to the Earth's survival.",
