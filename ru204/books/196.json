    "book_description": "Emergency landing. Uncharted planet. Erotic captivity of epic proportions. Right when Captain Alec Hamlin thinks it can\u2019t get any crazier, his team is sold to their captors\u2019 mighty sovereign. King Zercy of the Kr\u00ede. Ruler of the planet\u2019s most formidable species. Man, is he imposing. So regal and larger than life. And way too savagely handsome for Alec\u2019s liking. From the first moment he laid eyes on him, he knew the Kr\u00ede was trouble, knew he needed to steer clear of him at all costs. But when Zercy chooses Alec to be his personal pet, all plans to dodge the male fall by the wayside. Alec is forced to spend each evening in the alluring king\u2019s company, each night bound to the seductive king\u2019s bed. Wholly at his mercy. Utterly defenseless, in his own mind and most especially his restless body. His struggle is real. Because the more Alec gets to know Zercy, the more he realizes two things. The Kr\u00ede king is damaged\u2014unstable, not right, making him unpredictable and highly dangerous. But he is also innately kind beneath the raging storm that torments him. Kind and genuine, with a sad but beautiful soul. Something Alec fights with all he is, not to acknowledge. He can\u2019t fall for Zercy. Zercy is the enemy. The captor of both Alec and his team. Which means Alec needs to get them out of there, before it\u2019s too late. Before emotions overthrow logic and take control of the wheel. If only his body didn\u2019t crave Zercy so fiercely, and his heart didn\u2019t want him just as badly. With Search and Rescue due any day, and Alec\u2019s team getting antsy, Alec is forced to make a decision. He can\u2019t have it both ways. Is he the captain of his men, bound to obligation, or is he a man in love with a Kr\u00ede? Warning: Contains explicitly scorching gay sex with exotic and shamelessly kinky males of otherworldly descent.",
