When Bella goes to work as Mrs. Wilder's assistant, the opportunity of a lifetime pops up: travel with Gerri to another planet, a shifter planet, and help Gerri find a lion king his mate. Alyx Treyvaal isn't known for being patient. A lion doesn't ask for help. A lion doesn't apologize. And he most certainly does not purr. But once he meets Bella, he finds himself doing all of the above...except for purring. He will not purr. With wolves stirring all kinds of trouble for them and a cousin who would like to shred Bella to ribbons, things are not simple for the couple. Not at all. One thing's for sure, when his mate is taken and threatened, the entire planet will hear the lion king's roar.",
