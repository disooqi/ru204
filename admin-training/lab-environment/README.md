# Lab Environment

Each user gets a VM that runs multiple RES clusters and DNS.

From here, you can:
1. [Get a VM overview](Overview)
2. [Start VMs](start-vms)
3. [Use VMs]
4. [Create VMs](config-vms).

VMs are configured in 3 stages for easy re-config.

User VMs are started from a ***Stage 3 VM*** image or instance template.
