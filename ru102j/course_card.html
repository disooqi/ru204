  <h2>What you will learn</h2>
  <p>RU102J teaches students how to build robust Redis client application in Java using the Jedis client library.  RU102J focus on writing idiomatic Java applications with the Jedis API, including how to work with language specific patterns for managing Redis database connections, handling errors and using standard clases from the JDK.  The course material use the Jedis API directly and not any additional frameworks, so students learn the basic principles of working Redis.</p>

  <section class="about">
    <h2>What you will build</h2>
    <p>In order to get practical experience with Jedis development, as part of this course you will develop an online Java application to make bike sharing data available to end users.  This project consists of three components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Command-line data loading application</li>
    <li>Google Map overlay generator</li>
    <li>Web application for querying data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of these components will load and query data from Redis using a data model that will be developed as part of the course.  The project will involving developing with several Jedis APIs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hashes</li>
    <li>Sets</li>
    <li>Geospatial data </li>
    <li>Transactions</li>
    <li>PubSub</li>
  </ul>
  <p>...and demonstrate best-practices like proper Exception/Error handling and recovery, try-with-resource blocks, and proper connection management practices.</p>
  <h3>Data Loader application</h3>
  <p>The data loading application is a Java command line application which uses Jedis to load data about the bike sharing stations from flat-files (in JSON format).  The application will be designed to load the data into an empty database as well as do in-place updates of the data.</p>
  <h3>Map Overlay Generator</h3>
  <p>To help visualize and debug the data set, a second Java command line application will be developed to read station data from Redis and generate a Google map overlay file.  This overlay file will generate a map overlay containing all of the bike sharing sites within a specific metro area and can be loaded into Google Maps (free account) for display.</p>
  <h3>Web Application</h3>
  <p>The third component of the system that will be built is a web application using the HttpServer class provided by the JDK.  The server will implement a query API to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Query metadata about a bike sharing station</li>
    <li>Find sharing stations within a city</li>
    <li>Find sharing stations by location (latitude and longitude)</li>
    <li>Find the number of available bikes at a given station</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The server will also use Redis to implement a rate-limiting system on calls (either through Lua code or the Rate-limiter module).</p>

  <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
  <p>There are no course prerequisites for RU102J, but the course assumes the student already understands:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Java programming language</li>
    <li>How build build and compile Java software in a shell environment</li>
    <li>Redis and Redis Data Structures</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The course assumes that the student is familiar with Java programming and the standard tools like Ant, Maven, Gradle used in building Java software.  Students should already be familiar with Redis and Redis data structures to the level covered in RU101.</p>
   <h2>Software Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Web Browser: Firefox 39.0+ or Chrome 43+ (Internet Explorer is currently not supported)</li>
